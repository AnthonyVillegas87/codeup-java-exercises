    /*
    *       Bank Application - as a back-end developer you need to create an application to handle new customer bank account requests
    *
    *
    *   Read a .csv file of names, social security numbers, account type, and initial deposit.
    *   Use a proper data structure to hold all of these accounts
    *   Both savings and checking accounts share the following properties:
    *
    *   deposit()
    *   withdraw()
    *   transfer()
    *   showInfo()
    *
    *
    *   11-Digit Account Number( generated w/ the following process :
    *           1 or 2 depending on Savings or Checking,
    *           last two digits of SSN,
    *           unique 5-digit number,
    *           and random 3-digit number
    *           )
    *
    *   Savings Account holders are given a Safe deposit box, identified by a 3-digit number and
    *   accessed with a 4-digit code
    *
    *   Checking account holders are assigned a Debit Card w/ a 12-digit number & 4-digit PIN

    *
    *   The ShowInfo method should reveal relevant account information as well as information specific
    *   to the Checking account or Savings account;
    *
    *
    *  Objectives:
    * Develop a robust application architecture
    * Use when to use abstract classes & abstract methods
    * Use an interface API to receive information from a developer's application
    * Explore constructors deeper & use the super() keyword
    * Read data from a file & store in an appropriate data structure
    * Generate random numbers & work with String API
