    Given an array of intervals representing ‘N’ appointments, find out if a person can attend all the appointments.

    Example 1:
Appointments: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
Output: false
Explanation: Since [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, a person cannot attend both of these appointments.

Example 2:
Appointments: [[6,7], [2,4], [8,12]]
Output: true
Explanation: None of the appointments overlap, therefore a person can attend all of them.


The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N*logN), where ‘N’ is the total number of appointments.
Though we are iterating the intervals only once, our algorithm will take O(N * logN) since we need to sort them in the beginning.
