Sliding Window Pattern

In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList),
we are asked to find or calculate something among all the subarrays (or sublists) of a given size.

In some problems, the size of the sliding window is not fixed. We have to expand or shrink the window based on the problem constraints.
We will see a few examples of such problems in the next solutions.
